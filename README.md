# SSH: HTML5 Based SSH Client

SSHy is a HTML5 SSHv2 web client implementing E2E encryption that runs well on modern web browsers.

## About

SSHy is a fast and responsive SSHv2 web client with end-to-end encryption supplied by [SJCL](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl). SSHy implements a minimal subset of the SSHv2 protocol that provides and controls a pseudo-terminal. The terminal front-end interface is provided by [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/). Currently, in use at https://linuxzoo.net , a non-functional preview is available at https://stuicey.github.io/SSHy/.

## Features

* 8 Preset color schemes & Xresources upload and import
* UTF-8 Character support
* Automatic local echo detection
* Customizable terminal & font size
* Copy and Paste support for Chrome & Firefox
* Network Traffic Monitor

## Installation

Either copy or clone the repository into a directory being currently served by a web server and navigate to `index.html`.

Two versions of this project are supplied:
* `index.html` - The main page featuring a modal login container and modifiable destination IP.
* `wrapper.html` - A minimal wrapper intended for use with CGI builds. Features interactive terminal login and fixed destination IP. By default, SSH-RSA is disabled on this version. To enable it comment out `	transport.settings.rsaCheckEnabled = false;` inside `wrapper.html`.

The required files are:
```
css/*
fonts/*
js/*
index.html OR wrapper.html
```

For best performance, it is recommended to host a web socket proxy close to the traffic origin or destination. This can be done by modifying `wsproxyURL` near the top of `index.html` or `wrapper.html` to the IP or domain of a personal web socket proxy.

This project is intended to be used with [wsProxy](http://github.com/stuicey/wsproxy) provided as a submodule in `wsproxy/`. This application allows for IP multiplexing by appending the destination IP to the web socket proxy URI. You can find more details from the related [README](https://github.com/stuicey/wsProxy/blob/master/README.md).

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm i -g  wsproxy/
wsproxy
```

Other web socket proxies such as [Websockify](https://github.com/novnc/Websockify) should be compatible with `wrapper.html`.

## Building

This project uses the [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) to minify and compile the JavaScript. The two versions `index.html` and `wrapper.html` can be either compiled manually or through [Atom build](https://atom.io/packages/build).

Index.html
```
java -jar closure-compiler.jar --js_output_file=js/combinedLibs.comb.js js/defines.js js/src/*.js js/*.js '!**.comb.js' '!**Client.js'
```

Wrapper.html
```
java -jar closure-compiler.jar --js_output_file=js/combinedJS.comb.js js/defines.js js/src/*.js js/*.js '!**.comb.js'
```

## Compatibility

SSHy was designed to be compatible with a majority of SSHv2 servers. SSHy should be able to connect to any standard configured SSHv2 server that has the following algorithms enabled:

```
diffie-hellman-group-exchange, diffie-hellman-group14, diffie-hellman-group1
ssh-rsa
aes128-ctr
hmac
```

Both SHA1 and SHA256 are supported for diffie-hellman and HMAC algorithms.
